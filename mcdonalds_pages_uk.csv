When I called again, the supervisor was dismissive and refused to give her name or take responsibility.I request:A full refund, as promised, without requiring me to come to the store.A formal apology from the managers for their rude and unprofessional behavior.Until these issues are resolved, I will not return to McDonald’s, and I will leave this review up.

I was halfway through the meal and attendant was so rude and militant. I had spent £12 on a meal and was being queried for a syrup request which cost 50p. When I complained about the way I was treated, the response was that she had to make sure. Who goes into a McDonalds to fraudulently obtain a 50p syrup. Instead of apologizing for their mistakes, all I got was a lecture. I abandoned my meal out of disgust and the attendant promptly threaded it into their bin. Perhaps McDonald's is no more a place for decency. It is pitiful the quality of staffing at the Pompey centre. Eventually, I had to settle for my good old English breakfast. I am appalled at the level of savagery.",1

2,MRS GILLIAN GREEN,GB,"February 27, 2025",REALLY WISH I COULD GIVE NO STARS!,"REALLY WISH I COULD GIVE NO STARS!Recently ordered food including a Large McSpicy meal at a cost £8.19 , where the burger on its own is £5.79. Yet when it arrives or should I say doesn’t arrive (the burger) but you receive the rest of your meal (fries and drink), is the price of the missing item returned to you, the short answer is is NO. You receive a fraction of that price. So if you wanted to then buy that same burger again because you did not receive one in the first place, it would cost you the grand sum of £5.79 to obtain that burger. SURELY please somebody with some common sense, make this right. If are missing a burger out of your meal which will cost you £5.79 to replace then that’s what you should receive back or replace the burger it’s self for free. If I paid £8.19 for a meal which was incomplete, I received £2.73 back after complaining and then went to replace burger I was missing this meal would then have cost me £11.25. This is all without the cost of the delivery, which I had already paid first time round, so I would have the extra cost to myself either via their delivery system or fuel in my own car. This seems like a crafty way of getting extra money from customers. Oh then me being too trusting ordered again just 1 week later virtually the same order YES for the same meal again received no burger, now either somebody in that particular branch likes the McSpicy burger and chooses to retain in for them selves, or they are incredibly stupid. I really don’t want to believe that such a well known company can think this right or desperate for a few extra £s.",1

7,Amelia Donovan,GB,"February 26, 2025",Rubbish service at Admiral Eastbourne,"Ordered for delivery from the Admiral Park, Eastbourne branch and opened the bag and most of the delivery was missing. So we ordered 2 McDonalds breakfast meals and all they put in the bag was the hash browns and 1 McMuffin with no drinks and the other McMuffin missing. So incompetent as to whoever packed the bag cannot read a simple order that says 2 McDonald full meals so instead just threw in the bag hash browns and 1 McMuffin. Called the branch of McDonalds and spoke to Megan the manager who huffed and puffed down the phone and said it was the drivers fault and apparently it’s his job to check every single bag he delivers to make sure the order matches what’s in the bag.Now we are not stupid and it should be the McDonald employee who packed the bag to make sure he reads the order and packs it to what we paid for.So Megan told us to drive ti her NcDonalds branch as she can’t refund us but can give us the order again. So we drive down there and didn’t see Megan or any of the other managers even though we said what had happened to one of the McDonald employees so they gave us a cold looking Sausage and egg McMuffin and the 2 drinks which were missing originally.Now if McDonalds had any sense they would think we ordered a delivery to eat the breakfast as a meal then half of it was missing so they say on the phone we can’t have a refund but to drive down and they will sort it out only to be given the 3 missing items. So myself and my partner ended up eating half of it at home and half of it in McDonalds. What RUBBISH customer service for a big multi national company. Next time I will be going to the good old British cafe for breakfast. Plus for Megan the manager to say it’s all drivers job to stand there and check what’s in the bag against every order before driving off is total rubbish. She should have admitted it was her staff fault whoever packed the bag and I’m sorry McDonalds of you can’t get that right and recruit staff to do a simple task like that and also recruit a manager who cannot accept responsibility you need to look at who you are employing.

0,Sérgio Pessegueiro,GB,"January 16, 2025",McDonald’s and Uber Eats Failed to Deliver: Missing Items and Nonexistent Customer Support,"I ordered a McDonald’s meal through the McDonald’s app. The share box of cheese sticks did not arrive with the rest of the food. It was a pain in the backside to find Uber Eats McDonald’s contact information. Eventually, I found a way to chat with them. When I explained that I didn’t receive the item and would like either the food or a refund, I was told a refund for the order was not possible.This meant that I didn’t receive the item I paid for, nor did I get my money back. Even now, while writing this review, I can’t believe McDonald’s/Uber just stole from me. The £7 is not the reason why I feel so upset and revolted. It’s the fact that something/someone took my money, left me in a bad situation, and nothing was done about it!When person 1 in the chat said I couldn’t get a refund, I tried asking for a manager. Every time, I would get a message saying that the manager would say the same thing. I would again ask for the manager and would get the same response. Suffice to say, I never spoke to a manager because they refused my request to speak with one. What’s even more surprising is that they left the chat after concluding that they couldn’t do anything else for me (and also not getting the manager). This happened three times with three different ‘support’ people. Not once was I rude but still got mistreated like this. At some point, I asked to create a complaint when they told me that ‘We understand that you would like to file an official complaint. We would like to assure you that when you flag any concerns with us, we take all internal actions to make sure your query is appropriately noted.’ They proceeded to not give a case number or any sort of reference ID. I’m tired, I’m baffled. What the hell?",1

3,Stephen Byrne,GB,"January 16, 2025",McDonalds Crewmember vacancy,"I applied for a crewmember vacancy at the Eltham, Yorkshire Grey restaurant and had a group interview on 23rd December. Some weeks later spoke to manager yesterday (15/01/25) and was told to attend a shift trial today at 2pm. Upon arrival the manager then started to ask me my availability etc. This had already been asked at the group interview and the interviewer made notes. So why ask again? Is there no communication between managers at McDonalds?This ended up not as a shift trial at all, but by being told that they only needed somebody for outside maintenance. Basically cleaning outside of the restaurant of bins. car parks etc. Maybe I was just fobbed off by the manager today as I do not meet the criteria of a McDonalds employee being a mid 50's male!! Sounds like McDonalds are using ageism to select potential employees as well, and prefer to project a younger face towards their customers!!I was told that this role would not involve kitchen work as a crewmember. This was not mentioned at the interview and is in no way grouped as a ""crewmember"" vacancy but a solitary job as a cleaner. In fact at the group interview the interviewer said that you all be working in different areas of the kitchen and everybody would do their fair share of cleaning. Utter lies !!Totally misleading and McDonalds wasted 3 weeks of my time as I only live less than 5 minutes away, and was really interesting in working there.I would never again regard McDonalds as a valued employer and warn anybody to be careful what you may be asked to do as the job description is very misleading.

6,Paul Wheeler,GB,"July 18, 2024",This review is about McDonalds Chorley…,"This review is about McDonalds Chorley for which I give the lowest score possible of ONE Star. Not for bad service, poor food or lack of cleanliness but for dealing with me abysmally. I appreciate that the average intelligence of a McDonalds punter is pretty low so I can understand that the staff at this restaurant assumed the same of me when I stood at their busy counter and asked for a private discussion about a matter of some concern to me. I'll not over elaborate but safe to say that their parking cameras (UK PARKING CONTROL) logged my visit one afternoon and a return visit the following morning. They then assumed I had spent exactly 15 hours and 13 minutes in the car park and issued me with a parking charge of £100.00. They thought I'd camped out overnight in their car park. What a joke. I visited the Chorley McDonalds and was refused the opportunity to discuss this ludicrous situation privately away from the counter so had to stand and have the conversation for all and sundry listen in and may I add joining in. The young and inexperienced manager was completely non-plused as to exactly how to handle the matter so when a more senior lady joined her perhaps some common sense was going to prevail..? Absolutely not the case. Immediately, she was defensive and I was told in no uncertain terms that it was 100% my problem to remedy. Incorrect. The cameras are on McDonald's land under a McD contract with UKPC. It was their problem to sort out - not mine. Matters got to a head and I was asked to leave the restaurant which I was more than happy to do. They accused me of being aggressive - no i wasn't I was being assertive and that is a big difference.  It was the staff wishing to have this lively discussion in full view of the general public that led to a rising temperature during the conversation when members of the public actively offered their opinion as they wanted rid of me as I stood between them and their Big Mac, McFlurry - whatever.  So how did all this pan out in the end I hear you ask? UKPC initially stood their ground when I wasted both their time and mine writing letters (you cannot phone them to complain or appeal ) to point out their error. It was only when I landed the good fortune of  speaking to an extremely helpful chap at the McDonalds customer service helpdesk that the matter was finally cleared up and the parking charge cancelled. So why am I writing this review now? Many months have passed since my visit to McDonalds Chorley and I am still to receive an apology from this restaurant as to the incorrect and embarrassing manner in which they handled me and the matter at hand. They have my details as they were passed on to them by McDonalds head office but nothing has been forthcoming. Mcds head office 5 stars for your assistance. Mcds Chorley - if I could give you zero stars I would, but I can't, so you'll have to settle for 1 star. Train your staff please as to how to handle delicate matters more professionally. After over 30 years working in a customer facing role I'd be happy to do it for you.  ",1

5,Pammi Moss,GB,"December 29, 2024",Avoid unless you like cold food and the runs,"Went into the Blythe one on the A1 and ordered 2 plant burgers and fries.  They were brought out cold.  Which is boggling as plant burgers need to be made to order and we asked for no salt on the fries so they should of been straight out of the dryer as well. I asked them to be redone with new ones which although they said would take a while as they would have to remake them from scratch, they then brought out 90 seconds later.  (Just cooked??)Still cold though,  my child decided he was too hungry and ate his.  The employee tried to have a 10 minute argument in their defence of the burgers being 'freshly cooked' and no amount of explaining that if they had just come out the oven I shouldn't be able to hold the patty in my hand (she defended herself further by breaking apart the patty, sticking her fingers in it and telling me they are all cooked to the right temperature and that the middle was cooked.... it was warm at most.  I insisted on another,  wouldn't you if someone had had their greasy fingers American pie style in your burger?  I was told this would be 'cooked fresh' and it came out in under 2 minutes.  Low and behold it was only lukewarm.At this point I was sick of them standing at my table trying to argue that this food was piping hot when you can clearly see penguins trying to ski off it but by then I'd had enough and just told them to go.  There was no steam.  No heat and this was the same about the chips as well.  To top it all off i didn't leave the bathroom for the entirety of that evening after we had gotten home. So £15 for freezing food & gut rot. Next time we are desperately hungry and the only thing around is a McDonald's?  We're just going to eat the grass at the side of the road, it'll definitely be better for us and probably hotter too.",1

I tried to report this using the Uber Eats SMS link for live chat but that doesn’t work. Either the restaurant forgot the order (which admittedly has occurred many times, even when collecting orders myself) or the driver gave my food to whoever ordered after me while my food got cold, but still got theirs delivered to first.

14,boeing757,GB,"December 31, 2024","Visit McDonald’s in Dungannon for some of the poorest customer service and non-fast, cold food","Went to McDonald’s in Dungannon for breakfast yesterday morning as it seemed to be very quiet when I was in the area.I went in and there was a single customer sitting at his table, so I ordered at the “kiosk” self-service screen.  After 10 minutes (I checked the time on the receipt), nothing.  There was still only me and the other customer, and no-one in the drive-thru queue at this stage, so I went up to the counter and managed to get the attention of one of the staff.  I asked her about my order and held my receipt out, and she snatched it, and I’m not joking, she snatched it from my hand, said “we’re still waiting” and slapped in onto the counter before walking off!I went and sat down again at my table and 7 minutes later the order arrived, so 17 minutes after ordering.I’ve had issues with this branch before, mostly around food having so much cooking oil on it you could almost see your face reflected in it, but this is a new low standard for them; slow service, surly and rude staff, and cold food.They clearly don’t want the business, at least from those of us who actually physically go into the store.  Perhaps if I had ordered online, or sat on my ar$e in my car I may have got better service, and decent food.Thankfully Greggs opened literally a one minute walk away recently, so I think I’ll be going there from now on.Maybe the franchisee for McDonald’s Dungannon might like to have a chat with their staff….Contacting McDonalds is a joke and nigh-on impossible - even their feedback website mentioned on the receipt wasn't working when I tried, and apart from talking to a robot online, there's no other way to contact them in writing.",1

We did order milk shakes and mcflurries with our meals and the ice cream was a pool of liquid, probably because they stuck the cold bag to the hot bag. McDonald's should seriously think about returning to restaurant or drive thru orders only because it is getting out of hand. Why offer a service you cannot provide. Even when going to drive thru now they give you ice cream and drinks and ask you to park up. I once parked up and waited for my order and when they gave it to me, I showed them the ice cream and said it had melted and their response was, you could have eaten it.... who normally goes to a restaurant and orders dessert before main course!

Uber eats say McDonald's should refund, McDonald's say it is down to UberEats. UberEats have a phone number, but it took three sessions of nearly an hour each time to get through. McDonalds took my money, subcontracted delivery to a third party, did not provide the goods and services I paid for but won't give my money back, nor will the delivery service.

I checked my bank the money had gone out twice, I spoke to the manager and she told me she was well aware that there was a problem on the app when food was ordered to bay 6 and told me it’s been happening countless times and she was having to explain constantly to customers that she couldn’t do anything about it there, she told me to go on the McDonald’s app customer services to tell them so that I could get a refund back! Well, when you go on that app and try and contact McDonald’s, it is virtually impossible!! I couldn’t believe it, they make it that difficult and there is no way you can get a message to them!! So I’m hoping that I will somehow get my refund by highlighting this problem on here! I have screenshots of two identical orders came to my email ( order no 094 at 14.48! And 095 at 14.49!! So £3.49 X 2)  so two payments taken out of my bank! So I ended up with nothing and paid twice!! Absolutely disgusting!!! 🤢 I want my money back!!!

9,Lukas Gski,GB,"August 28, 2024",Disappointed and Frustrated – Unfair Parking Policy and Poor Customer Support,"I am extremely disappointed with my recent experience at McDonald’s in Rugby. As a loyal customer, I expected better treatment, but instead, I was penalized with a £100 parking fine simply for being delayed by McDonald’s own slow service.I visited the restaurant with my family, purchased food, and parked in their car park as a legitimate customer. Due to delays in food preparation—beyond my control—I exceeded the 60-minute parking limit by 26 minutes. Despite providing proof of my purchase and appealing to both McDonald’s and the parking contractor, I received no meaningful assistance.The signage in the car park is poorly positioned and unclear, making it difficult for customers to fully understand the parking terms. McDonald’s suggests that customers should speak to a manager if they think they might overstay, but this information isn’t displayed anywhere. It’s unrealistic to expect customers to predict delays caused by McDonald’s own inefficiencies!To make matters worse, McDonald’s customer service completely washed their hands of the issue, stating they have no power to intervene, despite the fact that they employ the parking contractor and are responsible for the parking restrictions. This is a clear example of a company refusing to take accountability for its own policies and how they impact customers.This entire experience has left me feeling frustrated, unheard, and unvalued as a customer. McDonald’s claims to prioritize customer satisfaction, but their handling of this situation proves otherwise. I can’t help but question whether they truly care about their customers or only about enforcing fines through a third-party contractor.I will be thinking twice before visiting McDonald’s again. I urge others to be cautious when parking in their car parks, as you may find yourself unfairly penalized like I was.",1

My food was delivered cold and inedible because McDonald’s uses Uber Eats for deliveries. Despite the restaurant being just 2 minutes away from my home, the delivery took over 20 minutes after being picked up because the driver prioritised other orders. By the time the food arrived, it was completely ruined.When I contacted McDonald’s about this issue, I was shocked to find out that they refuse to deal with complaints for orders placed through their own app. Instead, they told me to deal with Uber Eats directly. This is absolutely unacceptable – I ordered through McDonald’s, so they should take responsibility for ensuring their customers receive the service they paid for.Uber Eats was equally unhelpful, refusing to provide a refund and making me go through multiple frustrating chats with dismissive responses. McDonald’s choosing to outsource deliveries to Uber Eats without taking accountability for issues reflects poorly on the company.If you’re considering ordering from McDonald’s, avoid using their app at all costs. If something goes wrong, they will leave you to deal with the headache of resolving it yourself, which they make nearly impossible.",1

So I went through Uber Eats who gave me an £8 refund.  They said this was proportionate to my complaint.  I guess they presume I should reheat the food.  Well that isn't the purpose of a takeaway and I tried this before and got food poisoning.  Food can only be reheated so many times and God knows how often these burgers are reheated before being sent out.

All because people would rather buy proper food than Macd’s **** I’m guessing from my own purchasing. Yet you get a full breakfast roll for £4.50 being they sell that with a coffee better than McDonald’s can ever compete the way there going. Stop giving them the satisfaction and walk away.

Whenever I use the drive in at my local store I can never get a signal 4g or WiFi. The 4g fully appreciate is beyond their control but WiFi?All of these issues I have complained to McDonalds customer service, the restaurant, Uber and in many surveys - but it just seems to result in apathy.Today for me was the last straw. I placed a large McDelivery order of.apprpx £50 and in addition a £5 tip. The first order was missing 2 items. I re-ordered and the burger had incorrect items on it. I complained to Uber with photo evidence of the issues for both orders complete with photos of the receipts on the bags, and the email confirmation. I was told no refund could be issued due to McDonalds policy guidelines. I said please can you share those guidelines - 4 times - they would simply reply with understand your frustration nothing we can do blah blah.I have raised the issue with McDonalds customer service but instead of addressing the issue if I am lucky they will appease me with a free meal or burger - although it seems even these days that is not assured.I cannot be sure but it seems they are punishing consumers if they complain more than a set limit - it almost feels like all.consumers must be making up their issues. If so then please just investigate - don't penalise honest consumers - afterall you have a contract and obligation to them. I can only assume that what Uber meant by McDonalds guidelines because I had a genuine complaint with all the evidence. Your consumer rights remain the same and takeaways fall under the Consumer Rights Act 2015.Your contract is with the food outlet – not Uber, Just East, Deliveroo or anyone else who delivers it. If you ordered a McDonald’s – your contract is with McDonald’s.But there seems to be no recourse to address this anti consumer behaviour. I am very very sure I am not alone. I also suspect it is ignored due to it being low value items - but collectively I suspect it amounts millions of pounds. I just wish there was an avenue to complain to some consumer champion who will fight for consumers rights against bad practice exercise by two large organisations - it seems unfair it's always David Vs Goliath -  in my case McDonalds and Uber but mainly McDonalds.

I asked him to give me head office number and he refused until I put my foot down and than I was annoying as I asked him again something to bother him (the managers name is Amoy ) . This is a poor service and encouraging his staff to behave in this manner . I am truly appalled by this behaviour from McDonald’s staff . ",1

My breakfast was waiting on the counter with dozens of other orders being packed up for delivery there was four large brown packages that was sitting behind the counter when we came in 20 minutes previously said to the assistant where is our breakfast? She said we’re very busy at the moment with deliveries. I said that’s mine on the counter. It’s been there 10 minutes. We went to a different McDonald’s last week the one that we usually use and it was worse or due to the fact that McDonald’s now do deliveries. How things have changed people running around like headless chickens I can’t imagine what it would be like at 9:10 o’clock in the morning will never ever ever ever go back to McDonald’s again.

Ten days later and countless emails and phone calls I still have not received my refund. The lady at McDonald’s customer service who I spoke to was not interested and said they would only get involved if I hadn’t received the refund in 15 days.  I did point out I needed the money back in my account and asked if she could at least tell me the refund had been issued.  She said no and I would have to just wait.  She said it was an issue I should raise with Uber which I have many times but they told me because it was through the McDonald’s app I need to call them.  I’m going round in circles.

This new McRib is such a huge let down especially after the anticipation of its return. But please I promise you it’s disgusting and a complete waste of money.

There were no dips with the nuggets even though I ordered the Sweet and sour dip and the burger buns were so rubbery they were stretching when trying to eat them.I hat to try and salvage the trainwreck that was my order by placing the food in the microwave to heat them up. The cheese melted out of the burger and dropped on to the plate. It seems the only redeeming qualities this order had were the McFlurrys and drinks but, as the order was large and consisted of mostly hot food, I'm still going to give it one star. It was by far the worst order I received from McDonalds. It's disappointing really as McDonalds is my favorite fast food restaurant but I honestly think it's gonna be a while, if ever, that I place another order.",1

The dips were missing even though they were on the physical and digital receipt.  Thats just a regular annoyance.  what really grinded my gears was that the food was cold.

We did this and a young man said that its nothing to do with them and he gave us a number to call.  The number was the contact centre for managing the app.  Nobody cared that the food was stone cold.  All they cared about were delivery times.  I am appalled at the food quality so we had to bin it.  Not warming it up.  I didn’t pay for cold food.  We have been bounced from pillar to post with zero accountability.

11,JL,GB,"October 20, 2024",Serious Concerns Regarding the Quality and Hygiene of McDonald’s Breakfast Menu,"I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with the quality of your breakfast menu, specifically the muffins. On several occasions, I have received breakfast items that were excessively greasy, with the muffins literally dripping in oil. This is not only unappetizing but also raises serious concerns about hygiene standards in your kitchen.Frankly, I am shocked that food in this condition is being served to customers. It is far from the standard I would expect from a brand like McDonald’s, and I believe it could potentially be a health risk. I strongly urge you to review your food preparation processes, as this issue could be a violation of hygiene standards. Someone should be looking into this immediately, and I am seriously considering reporting this to the relevant health and hygiene authorities if the problem persists.The amount of grease in these breakfast items is unacceptable and leaves me feeling unwell after eating. At this point, I would not recommend McDonald’s breakfast to anyone unless this issue is addressed. I hope you take these concerns seriously and investigate the matter before it affects more customers.",1

13,Mark,GB,"October 20, 2024",McDonalds Catterick Garrison  ,"This morning I visited your drive-thru at Catterick Garrison around 6 a.m. and ordered four hashbrowns. Unfortunately, when I received my order, the hashbrowns were cold and tasted unappealing, with a cardboard-like texture.I returned to the restaurant to speak with the manager, who explained that the hashbrowns had been made a while ago. While I appreciate the explanation, I observed a rack of hashbrowns being held for future customers, which appears to contribute to them going cold. Since it was quiet at the time, with staff standing around and minimal activity, it seems that making food to order during such periods would be a better practice to ensure customers always receive fresh, hot items. Popular items like hashbrowns, if prepared too far in advance, quickly lose their quality.While I was inside the restaurant, I also noticed some staff drinking coffee within the food preparation area. I’m not entirely sure what the policy is on this matter, but I would have expected staff to take breaks or consume beverages in a designated rest area, out of sight of customers. It appeared unprofessional and potentially unhygienic, especially in a space where food is being prepared.Fortunately, I was provided with freshly made hashbrowns that were hot, crispy, and much more enjoyable. However, I wanted to bring these observations to your attention, as I believe it’s important that all customers receive food of this standard without needing to return for replacements, and that the environment reflects the professionalism McDonald's is known for.Thank you for your time, and I hope this feedback can help improve both the service and overall customer experience at your location.",1

FB5B9.Going through your app directs me to your customer service page where you have no alternative but to use the virtual assistant.Your virtual assistant doesn't use AI but just has pre-defined responses to its questions. These eventually lead to a point of uploading your receipt.When you order from McDelivery you don't get a proper receipt. It gets emailed. And you can't upload the email to the assistant because it doesn't accept PDF files. I can't save an email in any other format.You then refer me to the phone number that I was texted by the Uber driver who delivered it. That doesn't take incoming calls.The restaurant that sent the food doesn't answer its phone.Can you explain to me how I am supposed to raise an issue with you and get a refund for food I have paid for and not received? Or is that the intention?",1

The last order, and will be the final one, I got, the chicken sandwich patty was rock hard- the thinnest patty I've ever seen! Lettuce was brown as usual, and the mayo...Asda smart price mayo tastes better that! Looked like someone had literally thrown it together, hardly any chips and what chips there were they were certainly undercooked! It all went in the bin. In the past I've had fish burger that were black..how the hell can you serve that tp someone!! How can the staff at ALL McDonalds think that not checking orders are complete, missing sauces, straws etc and not checking quality of the food is ok? Because they cannot be bothered. The attitude from staff is laughable,  sullen, morbid faces. My dog smiles better than the majority of the staff. They don't even say hello and just look and sound extremely bored. When I've been through the drive thru i had a go at one server because she huffed at me. Lucky i didn't get out the car. I've also had sauce packets thrown at me by a staff member that cut my eyebrow. What did the manager do? Apologised and offered me a free meal! The server threw them at me because i said the sauces were wrong and put them back on the counter, but they slid off. Countless times over the years I've had items missed off, food cold. It's actually disgusting how McDonalds operates now and it's embarrassing! But yet, as long as money is going in the till who cares about customers!

It seems like what another reviewer has already said they value the just eat orders instead of the customers that visit the restaurant. I consider myself a loyal customer and I have quite a few points on my account but I will now be using them up and closing my account due to yesterday’s visit.My family visited and we had to wait for nearly an hour after ordering food through the drive through. I went into the restaurant to get help but no one would acknowledge me and in the end I had to walk back up the drive through lane to get help which I shouldn’t have had to do. (So did the person next to us) The food was cold so I send a complaint about the whole situation (which included because everyone in the car park had been parked from the drive though the feral kids in the car next door going to the toilet in front of our car in the waiting bay) I sent the complaint and then had a reply offering me a free medium meal. I didn’t send the complaint to receive any free meals but to tell them about the awful service I got but to then send a one free medium meal voucher seemed like they weren’t even interested in the feedback and just gave me an voucher to go away.  Yesterday’s experience was the last straw and we will not be using their restaurants again.,1

I then told him to hold on so I can come downstairs. I got downstairs and he was not there. I called him and told him he was at the wrong place and tried directing him.

Almost every time I get a delivery, something is missing, or they've replaced the item with something worse e.g. Milkshake for Orange Juice!? Can't blame Uber for that one.3. Waiting times when collecting in-store are absurd. Often 20+ minutes for a meal for one. Mostly because Drive Thru is prioritised. Thought this was meant to be fast food? 4. You think Drive Thru might be better? Wrong. You're almost always asked to park up somewhere and wait. Then some poor McD employee has to come find you in the car park, with 3 other orders in hand.5. More than once, they've run out of something. For example, one time they ran out of sausage meat for breakfast.

12,Paresh,GB,"September 11, 2024",Very Poor Hygiene Practices,"Absolutely disgusting!I don't blame the staff per say. I blame the franchise owners and  senior management at McDonald's head office.Staff at fast food restaurants have to multi task on such a level where standards suffer.A lot of businesses use staff cutting methods to maintain/increase their profits margins. But who suffers, us the paying customers, that's who, and quite possibly, staff moral.I've seen, on many occasions, staff cleaning toilets at McDonald's Restaurants without wearing any adequate PPE. Whilst staff have informed me they have a sink at the back to wash their hands, I am not convinced they do.As far as I believe, after staff clean these (sometimes) excrement stained toilets without gloves etc, they possible may go back to cooking our food again.It's the same with staff who smoke! Do they really wash their hands after a quick cig in their breaks?Legislation and in-house company hygiene policies are only as good as McDonald's senior management taking responsibility to enforce them, otherwise it's just a piece of paper, paper that probably I could have used tonight, as there was no toilet tissue in the disabled toilet.Nor did the Clifton Moor Maccys have any hand wash. The tap was in a disgusting state too.Why is it, in this day and age, especially with our current technology, McDonald's doesn't have hands free toilet flushing or hands free washing facilities? It's beggars belief.😬Other (not many) profit making businesses do.I'm surprised no one has been seriously ill with food poisoning, especially food that's not fried or piping hot.I feel the Health and Safety Executive should be informed about these substandard hygiene practices at many, if not, all McDonald's Restaurants in the UK.When I asked immediately for a refund on the food ordered, the shift manager/leader was not happy...but can you blame me?Instead of paying large bonuses to CEO's/directors, get your house in order McDonalds!👎🏾",1

I drives away to find the burger was cold, the fries unsalted and the coke flat.  A hat trick.  Three out or three failing to meet the basic standard.

I had already bypassed the McDonald's at the nearby services, as they do not have a good reputation.  I arrived at 10.58 and was understandably told that they were still serving breakfasts.  Therefore, after giving my order, so they had a heads up as I would be requiring a fish finger ""happy meal"", which is a contradiction in terms.  I informed them that I would go around the building and come back which I did.  I ordered the meal and was asked to go to the next window to wait  always a bad move as I have had this experience in the Llanelli outlet and yes was forgotten about, which I had to complain about before.  Why is it a problem that the only meal geared for a child, who haven't got patience understandably, and would appear to be the easiest part of the menu to prepare, is the the most problematic meal to get right!  I sat there for three minutes, even though other cars were receiving their large bags of food behind me, when a member of staff came to our window to say they could not find the fish fingers, WHAT!  I did find this quite funny, not when 14 minutes went by.  This was when I shouted through the window to remind them we were still there.  Miraculously, a girl in a white blouse came with our food half-heartedly apologising, the emotion did not show in her eyes  I for one, do not appreciate ""lip service"".  I said that 14 minutes was not acceptable, to which she tried to say something about the temperature of the fish, to which I responded ""they are fish fingers"".  I was in a hurry so just drove off but asked my Grandson to pass me a chip and part of a fish finger and YES they were tepid, obviously been left on the side and forgotten about.  I have had a good experience of this McDonald's before, but there was a responsible older lady running the drive through, not young kids who obviously have not been taught soft skills, just the minimum amount of training, in my opinion.",1

7,Mel,GB,"January 17, 2024",Doesn't comply with regulations of Equality Act 2010,"The Colindale (NW9) branch in London was recently renovated and has failed to take the Equality Act 2010 into consideration. The downstairs section of the restaurant cannot be accessed by disabled or wheelchair users. People with pushchairs cannot access it too as there are no lifts in the restaurant. I find this ironic as the downstairs section has been designed specifically for children. The children's parties are held there and it features tablets and games specifically for them. As a mother who has a pushchair, I cannot access that area. I attended a party which was held in the downstairs section of the restaurant where I asked staff for assistance with taking my pushchair downstairs, I was refused help and had to struggle on the stairs which was extremely dangerous for myself and my baby. We used the self service screens downstairs to order food however, we had to go upstairs to collect our food. Once again, I found this difficult with my baby. A friend of mine was also invited to the party however they could not attend as they are a wheelchair user and had no access to the party area. The store needs to be renovated again to include a lift. Only a fool would design a store and put the kids area in a place that is not accessible for parents with pushchairs, wheelchair users or people with mobility difficulties. ",1

I am sure Uber do not prepair or bag up the order so i questioned this and he said i can only buy another meal as he will be out of pocket giving away free food.The Uber customer service wasnt much better so i am now stuck with no meal and a £1.88 refund that cant even buy me the breakfast item i wanted.Awful service and passing the buck between each other.,1

This insipid burger was truly awful, it was flat, the patties were minute, the lettuce was soggy, the bun was some kind of alien bread and worst of all, it was really dry and I struggled to consume what amounted to a few painful bites. The staff looked like they didn't want to be there either, it didn't look like they were working as a team and it showed in the time it took for my 'meal' to arrive. I was informed that it may of taken longer as they now cook to order, if that is the case and this is the best they can do 'to order', then they are in deeper trouble than I first thought.What happened to the McDonald's of my childhood? Was it just a fuzzy memory that it was ever good? It's not cheap either and if they are going to enter the price range of the excellent burgers on offer elsewhere, then they need to step up or start from scratch. I regret being influenced by the advert, have drummed it into my children that it is not a good place to eat and have decided that I am well and truly done with the place.",1

Then discover a whole meal missing! Called the McDonalds restaurant and they gave me Uber eats contact number and said they are the ones only able to sort it, they said I would receive my compensation for the whole order so I’m able to retry, this included service and postage costs to. I also think that McDonalds are hugely responsible as food items were missing, this would have been before Uber took over the order.

I received a confirmation of a refund for £4.43 from Uber Eats which they are processing. That doesn’t cover the cost of the Big Mac and medium fries missing! Neither does it cover a missing meal, the rest of the food cold and the McFlurry like foam! Clearly states on my receipt that the Big Mac was £5.77 alone!

Almost as if it was the only thing they could offer to make things up. Maybe it usually works and she didn’t know what to say or do to me refusing this kind offer?

Anyway, the guy who served us confirmed our order as he handed it back and off we headed back to Ipswich. My dad has his burger as we got back to ipswich and noticed that the other wasn't in there. I obviously wasn't going to go all the way back to Felixstowe so I pulled into my local. Anyway, the manager who works for a 178.66 billion pounds company twould rather have an argument in the drive through with me than give me 1.39 burger I'd paid for. I ended up buying another one because I felt guilty for my dogs. Now, people make mistakes and that's fine. But what I hate about this situation is that I was so embarrassed and gutted about the waste of money because times are hard at the moment and I was only trying to do something nice, that I wanted to cry, and I also hate how they made it my responsibility to be inconvenienced further by going back to Felixstowe for a 1.39 burger when it was their mistake, not mine. I'm disappointed at the company, completely deflated after having a nice evening with my dad and dogs, and I think you need a rethink on how you take care of customers as well as accountability. ",1

I gave him hus medicine and thank god we were lucky it was just a bit of slight itching . Your staff put mcds sauce in his burger which is mayo which is made with raw egg.that could of been fataL for my grandson.

But now, it’s just rubbish. From the restaurants themselves, the atmosphere and the food itself, it seems to have lost its soul, and for what it is, very expensive. My last visit (and I’ll never return) I ordered a quarter pounder, I remember it was massive but it his was served in a standard burger bun, and tasted terrible, I didn’t bother with the fat laden fries and the drink was mostly made up of ice.

The burger literally looked like it had been stamped on with more of the cheese in the box than on the burger. 25 minute wait in the drive thru. Some items missing, as I know you must check at the window as this happens every single time ( if only I'd counted the nuggets in the box too!!!). The staff don't know the meaning of customer service, and why would they at an average age of 17. Absolutely appalling store that I've now given up on.

This discovery was not only alarming but also raises serious concerns about the hygiene standards at this location.When I returned to the store to address this issue, I was met with a dismissive attitude. Despite my attempts to explain the situation, the staff insisted that the burger was merely damaged, which I strongly contest. I can clearly distinguish between a damaged bun and one with bite marks. The staff's refusal to acknowledge this and their lack of empathy were both disappointing and frustrating.The manager's response was particularly disheartening. Instead of offering an apology and understanding the gravity of my concerns, they abruptly interrupted me and seemed more interested in ending the conversation quickly than in resolving the issue.Regardless of whether the bun was damaged or bitten by an animal, it is entirely unacceptable to serve a customer a burger in such a condition. The lack of hygiene and the poor customer service I experienced are inexcusable.",1

She brought her favourite Big Mac meal, the Burger bread tasted different than before but she thought nothing of it. A few minutes later she felt really ill her throat was closing off and had a swollen face she went to hospital they told her she’d had an allergic reaction to the ingredients in the brioche bread to many eggs and butter that creates a smoother high gluten in the mixing process. So after a few days recovering she went to a MacDonald restaurant and ask them why they’d changed the buns? They said the buns are cheaper and decided to change to brioche right across there burger range.. so they chose to change without telling people what they were going to do that put her life in danger cost cutting isn’t always for the better she could of died because they didn’t disclose that they was changing the burger buns. She questioned MacDonalds on Facebook messenger all they said  “we decided to change the buns across there range of burgers”!! They just said they improved the classic’s range.

16,Jonathan Perkins,GB,"June 08, 2024",Unacceptable customer service from such a large company,"I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with the current process for addressing issues with customer orders placed through your app and McDelivery service.  Recently, my 14-year-old daughter, who was away from home, used your app to order food for herself and her friends. Due to the distance from the nearest McDonald’s, they relied on your delivery service. Unfortunately, when the order arrived, the restaurant failed to include my daughter’s meal, despite it being listed on the receipt. This left her without food for the day and without access to local amenities for an alternative.Upon contacting the restaurant, we were advised to use either the virtual assistant on your app or call 0800 088 5663 to arrange a refund. Our primary concern was not a refund but ensuring my daughter received her meal. Despite this, the manager at your local restaurant insisted this was the only available option.We attempted to resolve the issue via your app, only to find that the virtual assistant directs users through a pre-defined process that does not accommodate specific concerns. This appears to be a deliberate strategy to avoid addressing customer complaints effectively, resulting in significant frustration.Calling the customer service number led to an interminable wait with no human assistance. After 90 minutes on hold, we were forced to abandon the attempt.  The order in question was under £10, yet the time and effort spent attempting to resolve the issue have far exceeded this amount. My primary objective was to ensure my daughter had food. McDonald’s has made this impossible. The local restaurant manager was unhelpful and demonstrated a complete lack of duty of care.I am extremely disappointed by McDonald’s apparent disregard for customer satisfaction and the cumbersome complaints process, which seems designed to dissuade customers from lodging complaints. The absence of an email address for customer service further compounds this issue.  Due to this situation, I had to alter my plans, travel to my daughter with food, incurring additional time and fuel costs, and purchase alternative food.",1

I got it, luke warm fries & a QP with cheese on it. Eat the fries as I was hungry, went back & the guy was still waiting for his meal which he didn’t get until after my order was remade. It seems cars are the priority there as you could see staff taking food to the window on numerous occasions, but those who could be bothered to come in had to wait.PS, I didn’t see any cars when I arrived, so these must have been coming in after we had ordered.",1

Contacted Uber customer service as I was told that McDonald’s is not responsible for missing items which I don’t understand why because they are the ones who packing it and the bags are sealed so there is no way that a driver could have taken it out from the bag. Uber costumer service assured me that I will get a refund for my missing item which I did but the refund was made by the wrong item, and instead of getting my £6 back I got refunded £1.99 for a flat bread. In general never had a good experience in this particular branch, always missing items from order either way you ordering online or in restaurant. I don’t think staff was ever trained on what is good customer service is. From my own experience and looking at reviews in general for Newmarket branch looks like there is ongoing issues there for a long time and no improvement made or issues solved.

The fries were cold and soggy, and the burger looked nothing like the advertised picture – it was sloppily put together with ingredients haphazardly thrown in. The dining area was dirty, with tables uncleared and trash overflowing. The restroom was equally unkempt and lacked basic supplies like soap and paper towels.

I don’t know how much money McDonald’s are saving by these very small portions but clearly it’s a lot for them to keep doing it. I just wish the prices had gone down accordingly as I would say the size of my McDonald’s McFlurry is now a quarter of what it used to be and yet the price is double!!

Ordered two special McFlurry and one normal sadly however McDonald’s seem to be doing what everybody else is doing, in  other words, putting the prices up and reducing the portion sizes. The amount of ice cream in the cup was almost invisible,  when are these companies going to realise that you can’t keep reducing The portion sizes. Sadly, this platform won’t allow me to show you a photo, but if it could, you would see that the cup would float away in the air due to lack of ice cream. I would also like to add that it’s incredibly dangerous to allow mc delivery drivers to turn around in the entrance to exit through the entrance onto the wrong side of the dual carriageway. ",1

They miss an item off of your delivery that you've paid your hard earned money for. Then accept its missing but only refund you half of the money. They're literally stealing from their customers.

It comes totally dry and ugly ! And I was used to something totally different. I had a friend in Slovakia, who was working as a manager in MC, and I knew that the rules were very strict, and the food that has been there for more than 15 minutes had to be thrown away! To the bin.In UK you get a dry bun, dry meet, and small salad that u can barely see. Food looks and tates like it was taken from that bin...I had a chance to eat MC in more than 8 countries durring my life, and unfortunately I have to say that MC Donalds in the UK is the worst I have ever tasted WORLDWIDE.I guess it is the culture or different priorities or whatever, but the brand should be the same everywhere.",1

The nuggets are supposed to be 100% chicken breast but the ones in this delivery were definitely not chicken breast. They were the cheap kind you get for a £1 a bag at farm foods.

15,JL,GB,"April 07, 2024",I used the McDonalds app to try it out - DON'T DO IT,"I used the McDonalds app to try it out. I had no idea Ubereats was the delivering peeps or i wouldn't of touched it. I've already had an awful experience with Ubereats 2yrs ago and never used them again. But hey ho, hoped for the best but no! Driver left the restaurant at 20:45pm as the tracker part of the app activated and i watched the guy drive around and then i got a text at 20:58pm saying I was the next delivery, so at this point my food had already been in his car for 15 mins, but i only lived 2 minutes away from his location so should of got there by 9pm. But no. The guy didn't bother reading the delivery notes and ended up at the wrong address. He messaged me to say outside, which he wasn't. I phoned him and no apologies no nothing, just told me to walk the roads to find him he was outside number 20 and that's all he would say on repeat. I said no, it's late at night and i could see on the tracker he was in the wrong road. I told him the correct directions and then he hung up on me without saying sorry or ok. I assumed he was coming. I waited 5mins and he didn't move from his location. I rang him back again and he told me to come and find him and meet him. I again told him no, i am a lone female and for my safety he needs to deliver to the correct address as stated on the order. I am not walking the dark streets searching for a stranger with a car. He basically refused to come to the correct address, so after 20mins of my food being held hostage at the wrong address, I rang Ubereats directly to get them on the phone while this was all happening. I told customer service the exact scenario unfolding and that my food was being held hostage in a few roads down unless i went and got it myself. at 21:17pm the driver finally knocked on the door and I had it out with him so Ubereats customer service could hear he had my food for 30mins! (had them on speaker phone but customer service agent tried to claim he didn't hear anything). The driver didn't speak a word to me at all and walked away, so i opened the bags and told the person on the phone the food was cold and both milkshakes and mcflurrys were completely melted,like water.. BUT... Uber eats hides behind this ""it was delivered within the latests estimate arrival"" i was not having this, as it wasn't like he was stuck in traffic, he was genuinely 2 roads down wanting me to walk to his car in the middle of the night. Something VERY VERY VERY WRONG with this. But the customer service agent wouldn't refunded us for the cold and melted food that was no longer edible and said the same thing over and over ""delivered within latest estimate time"" and then also hung up on me. Both the driver and customer service agent hung up on me. the rudest thing to do to a customer.Uber eats might as well save money by getting rid of the customer service department, seeing as zero customer service happens and just play a voice over telling customers to go F themselves. Pretty much what they do now.so they took my money, held my food hostage for 30mins until it was completely ruined, refused to refund me and we had no money left to order anything else. So we had to go bed hungry.I'm actually still in shock over this. I urge everyone to jump to deliveroo, i have zero problems with them and the drivers are really nice and polite and actually communicate with you and wouldn't ask you to walk the dark streets to find them. Also cheaper fees.Obviously sad story people won't boycott McDonalds but they should to improve on customer service. Billions this restaurant makes but can't go with a decent delivery company.McDonalds have a customer service section on the app but it just redirects you to Ubereats. So no one takes responsibility.

Ordered 2 meals and a burger was missing, called customer service to try and get couriers number and they refused even though it came up when I ordered.. unfortunately I didn’t realise the number disappears straight away. They asked what I was missing and said they would refund me £2 for the burger, when I said on the receipt it’s 6.97 they said it’s their policy, they refuse to let you speak to management and say there is no way to escalate as they are working to their “guidelines”. I asked if they would refund the burger and delivery so I could re order and they said no, they seemed to think that a person ordering a meal and only getting the side and drink was totally acceptable. They were rude kept saying I don’t understand and can you hear me which was infuriating. Best thing if you have a missing item is call the store so they find out what uber eats are doing as I see from the reviews this is happening all the time. I’m so annoyed I pre gave a tip as well. I’ll never order via conning uber eats ever again. Uber eats is an absolute joke.",1

Finally got through to customer services to be told as far as they were concerned the food arrived on time.... because they kept putting the time back on the app and conveniently we could not track our order either. We stressed that it was not acceptable to be made to wait an hour foe a 10minute journey and we have not been provided a service we paid for. The lady on the other end of the phone was very rude and not apologetic at all so we have effectively thrown £30 down the drain as the food was inedible! Absolutely disgraceful behaviour.

Used my McDonald’s points for some of my items.Courier spilled my drink - paid for with points - contacted customer service at uber eats via the virtual chat - they won’t help with anything as it was a ‘free’ item.So they advised me to contact McDonald’s.  The store wouldn’t do anything as it was the courier fault not them.  The courier pointed me to the virtual assistant.  The virtual assistant sends me round and round on a loop.  Cannot explain the situation fully to a person just a bit and each time I get told to contact Uber Uber advised me to order it again. I told them I can’t as I have used the points now - So uber eats aren’t interested. McDonald’s aren’t interested as it wasn’t their fault. Uber Eats believes that McDonald’s should just give me the points back but I get that McDonald’s would think this would come out of their pockets - because it would!!I don’t care who resolves it but one of them should. This may have been paid for with points but those points transferred to product that costs money to buy.Anyway I’m going round in circles - aware this is first world problems because it’s JUST a cappuccino BUT it’s the principle of the matter.  I earned the points and the right to spend them.  Uber are subcontracted by McDonald’s and failed me - neither organisation will take responsibility and the consumer misses out. Looks like I can say goodbye to the McDonald’s pointsUpset with both uber eats and McDonald’s on this one - they really should talk and resolve points issues and McDonald’s can’t always say that it’s diners fault when they entrust uber to manage their deliveries.Accidents happen and I get that more than most - it’s how the situation is resolved that sets an organisation apart on its customer service. Uber and McDonald’s did not do this,2

I phoned through to the gallagher retail park which is another store that bob moorcroft owns and they answered straight away. The lady gave me the number for uber eats who was not willing to replace the mcmuffins instead they was going to refund £6 for 2 double sausage and egg with no egg mcmuffins. This was part of a delivery offer so I explained to uber eats it would have cost me a lot more than that if I had of had to replace them myself I had to get my kids to go down to the store to replace them which is not fair on them, a breakfast that turned out to be a disaster because the staff think it's alright to use stale muffins 😕 Bob moorcroft please sort your staff out mate, I am friends with pat from worksop one of your old managers ",2

I remember a very good staff member called zara but I think she's left. She was head and shoulders above the others. Very polite , attentive and courteous. The staff now are on the whole horrible. I even over hear small snippets of their talk while I'm seated and they often if I'm not mistaken make disparaging comments about me which has often nearly been the final straw. I won't push that since I might be mistaken. I hear only snippets. They are just a horrible staff. Mainly young but there are others much older and equally horrible. Very unsociable.  Very discourteous. I once even openly complained and all they did was disagree that they'd been rude saying they'd never been rude to me. It's likely they hate the job and it spills over to customer service which doesn't exist. I come every day . Well each morning early. Its very unusual that one of them says a single word to me. No thankyou. No asking if I want sugar. Then they go back into kitchen and continue their conversation with eachother. The food is OK. The only thing that is OK.

As a family, this meal is something the kids look forward to every week, and it’s incredibly disappointing when parts of their meals are missing or incorrect. The excitement they feel when their meal arrives quickly turns to frustration and upset when they realize their order isn’t complete.It's heartbreaking to see their disappointment, especially as this is something meant to bring them joy. We’ve always appreciated the convenience and quality of your service, but this consistent issue is undermining the experience.

So, I retried a few times, and it failed exactly the same every time.  I generally find the app terrible anyway.  I also had loads of rewards where I could have various things for free but as the app was preventing me submitting the order I was unable to use them.As I had promised my son a McDonald's it meant I had to use one of the other delivery apps, which annoyed me greatly because I then had to pay full price for everything where I should have got some free due to my rewards.  What is the point of the rewards if you can't use them!!!!  It also means that I haven't earned any additional rewards as I've had to order through a proper delivery app.  Then the food turns up stone cold.  So, overall, I was very unhappy.Oh, and I have even tried to find contact details for submitting a complaint or to give feedback.  On the main support page they do say you can give feedback, either good or bad.  But then when you go through there you cannot select anything to give feedback.

The Beverley, East Yorkshire branch has a few staff members who are always kind and helpful. Yes, sometimes I’ve waited about 10 minutes in the drive through for my food and yes, some of my orders have been wrong (I always check before driving off). My main issue with McDonald’s is how their menu has gone downhill so much. First they took out the £1 sundaes, I used to love getting the toffee sundae, cheap and easy, ice cream plus sauce. Then they took out the breakfast bagels, by far the most superior breakfast menu item. Now I see they have brought back the galaxy mcflurry without the offer of the galaxy caramel one - which is far better in my opinion. I never buy the sweet treats anymore, the sugar ring donuts are way overpriced which is why they will soon disappear I imagine. Everywhere has seen a price increase and McDonald’s was doing well, offering the saver menu items still below £1.50, but the ‘main’ burgers and highlighted menu item meals are now around £10. I’ve only ever had delivery once but since Uber eats is the worse food delivery company and I don’t trust the hands of the drivers I always go pickup the food myself. The reason it’s cold for most is because of the time it takes between cooking and delivering. Not worth it at all but can’t blame McDonald’s for lazy and slow delivery drivers. ",2

13,Miss Judi O'Regan,GB,"May 16, 2024",Improved classics? I don't think so.,"Your new ads are banging on about a marked improvement in your classic burgers. Really?Sorry but, after my visit to your Dartford branch, I just don't see it. The same old tasteless beef patty, carelessly slapped onto the bun so that half of it was hanging out. When I tried to move it to the centre, the rubbery cheese had glued it in place. So on one side I get burger, the other just bun and cheese. This unappetising mess was covered with a teeny smear of ketchup, and far too many big lumps of raw onion. It was utterly disgusting. This branch in Dartford is a badly managed, disorganised mess in general. The order screens never have working receipt feeds. The orders are really slow in coming - too slow in fact. I thought this was supposed to be fast food! The table service is terrible, so orders are sitting on the counter getting cold. I don't think I'll be eating there in future.",2
14,Darren,GB,"May 12, 2024",Poor Advertising.,"I don't often have a day time meal at Mcdonalds i prefer the breakfasts, but i really fancied a Strawberry milkshake and McFlurry as it was a hot day. I visited the Holdingham roundabout Mcdonalds at Sleaford, i entered the drive thru but was very surprised that there was very little advertising of products, i didn't even see a menu. It was as though you should know what you want before entering which may be the case if your regular. Before i knew it i was at the speaker being asked what i wanted so i just went for the basic quarter pounder to go with my milkshake. The service was good but the food not so good, Chips need salt on and the Beef burger had a sauce on it that i think is new (a part of the classic range re vamp) the sauce was not that nice and there was far to much on the burger, infact that much it ruined it. Conclusion, much more advertising of the menu coming in to the drive thru, go back to salt on your chips as they are bland without it and get rid of that strange tasting sauce.",2

Conscious that I’d missed my daughter’s bedtime, I was pleased to see some colouring and puzzle sheets for kids left on one of the tables. One of the staff members ‘Susie’ (I hope I’ve spelt that correctly) saw me take a couple of the pieces of paper for my daughter. She promptly disappeared into a side-room and came out with a game, a couple of crayons, some puzzles and a mask. It really is the little things in life that can touch someone’s day. I know how excited my daughter will be tomorrow morning on seeing the activities for her to complete; it also let’s her know Dad has been thinking of her. Thank you Susie for the thought and for your cheery disposition… the world would be a happier place with a few more Susie’s in it!! Also, the double cheeseburgers I had were well made! As a seasoned veteran at many of the local McDonalds, far too many of the double cheeseburgers have ketchup all up the sides and are wonky (like they’ve just been thrown together). These were like doubles used to be, neat with the ketchup in the middle!! Cracking job to McDonalds Fleet all round :)",5

I was dressed as an elf and took 18 kids aged between 2 and 13 after a trip round the Leeds christmas lights on one of our buses. There were 19 adults within the party too, some also dressed as elves 🤣. I went to.order the 18 meals for the kids and the poor girl behind the counter looked shell shocked as i told her most of the adults were going to order meals too. She let the kitchen staff know and they also looked a bit shell shocked. At that point the manager spoke to them and told them not to worry  they all knew what they were doing and to reset back to their stations and they could do it. I was really impressed at his pep talk. He was so calm and encouraging to them. They all cracked on and we were served extremely quickly for the size of our order with no errors. Quite an achievement for the amount of meals ordered all at once. The young girl who brought out our meals was so nice and efficient. She also brought out lots of grinch headbands  grinch flags and balloons for all the kids. I just want to say a huge thank you to all staff involved. You were amazing!

He was happy and courteous and genuine not scripted. I drove to the next window and complimented his kind demeanour and cheery nature. As there was no queue he told me ""thank you I always am because it doesn't matter if you are having a good day, bad day or something else going on. I always smile for the customers"". Having worked in retail for nearly 30yrs and lived by the same value I thanked him again and told him to keep it up. Unfortunately I could not see his badge for his name so when I arrived at the next window and received my food from the lovely girl I asked her what the lads name at the drive thru. She said his name was ""cole"" I really hope Cole realises what an asset he is to the hospitality and service sector and that he does receive recognition for his genuine service from his leader. Having experienced and worked with alot of people who merely come to work, get through their shift and leave, Cole was a breath of fresh air and seemed like he took pride in his job and this is a rarity these days.

It is for one member of staff who handled a disgusting man who claimed to have autism, who verbaly attacked some poor pregnant woman, he made an evil comment to her saying I hope you have a miss carage. The amazing lady named ceciel, came to the ladies rescue by putting the rude man in his place, which led to him to storming off. She deserves a huge recognition from here employer. She then delt with my issue, which has been an ongoing problem at all mcdonalds, and petty it may be, I'll bet all of you agree, why can you not get a full portion of Fries!!! Large portion was more like a small, I can only imagine how much extra money all branches make for short portioning their Fries. Both our burgers came barely wrapped. It would seem speed of getting the food out is more important than handing out correct food. Lucky for us ceciel was in hand to quickly right the wrong of her fellow team members.She was a happy delightful soul, and it's people like her that make good of a bad situation. She also I might add returned to the pregnant mother to be, to makesure she was ok and put a caring arm over her shoulder and made sure she was ok, not that you would be after a comment she had recieved.I think mcdonalds should go back to the cctv and find this man's image and ban him from all your stores.

The facility does get very busy particularly when swarms of local college students emerge during their break periods. This puts  the staff  under pressure trying to get orders out as quickly as possible. In addition, bins become full and litter gets left and strewn about along with spilled drinks and cartons. The staff are efficient, hardworking and very pleasant to customers. However we have noticed on many occasions, one member of staff is very special and stands out above all others. Her name is Montana. This young lady is remarkable because her tenaciousness in clearing away left over food and general waste, cleaning tables, mopping floors as well as serving table orders never stops. Her workrate is just amazing! We were delighted to hear that Montana has recently been promoted, because it is so well deserved - she is a great representative! In addition to the above she has a lovely personality, is always polite and goes that extra mile to ensure MacDonald's remains a great dining experience  as well as being a 'fave' place to eat!

Fantastic service from the manager James, we told him we were coeliac and asked if he would be able to safely accommodate us with a couple of burgers without buns (we brought our own buns). He was extremely reassuring and said that he would make them personally and to our specific order with extra gerkins, no ketchup etc He assured us there would be no cross contamination. The proof was in the pudding that neither of us had any symptoms afterwards. Thank you James, we are very excited having not had a burger from Maccies in 10 years!",5
